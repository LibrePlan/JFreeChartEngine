ABOUT
 * Since version 5 of ZK (www.zkoss.org) there are some components that are no longer free as they used to be on their latest stable release (version 3.6.4). One of those components is the JfreeChartEngine, used to draw the charts.

   This component is a fork from its GPL version at ZK 3.6.4 and initially used at Navalplan (www.navalplan.org) but it's free to use and modify by whoever wants as it's released under the AGPL license (so remember to share your changes).

NOTES ABOUT USAGE
 * To change the engine that draws the charts on your ZK application you have to add a configuration property to your zk.xml file:

   (on WEB-INF/zk.xml)

   ...
   <library-property>
       <name>org.zkoss.zul.chart.engine.class</name>
       <value>com.igalia.java.zk.components.JFreeChartEngine</value>
   </library-property>
   ...

SUPPORTED CHARTS

 * Currently the only supported charts on this engine are:
      
      - TimeSeries
      - Bar
      - Bar3D
      - Pie
      - Pie3D

 * If you add any other format and wish it to be added to the component please send me a patch

DEPENDENCIES

 * This component has dependencies with ZK and jfreechart. They are all setup on the pom file.
 * This component was built using ZK 5.0.9 but it might work with older releases (not older than 5.0.0). Just change the <zk.version/> tag in the pom file to match your ZK version. 

INSTALL

 * If you have maven (http://maven.apache.org/) installed on your computer just issue: mvn install
